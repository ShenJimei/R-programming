# The data is saved to care_df by reading the file outcome-of-care-measures.csv. By writing a function called best, the best hospital in the state is found. The function has two parameters, one has two letters. The abbreviated state name, and the other is the result name, including (heart attack, heart failure, pneumonia), and the function returns the hospital name with the lowest 30-day mortality rate. When dealing with rankings, if the mortality rate is equal, the hospitals are sorted alphabetically, taking the first hospital
# Pay attention to checking the type of data read in order to avoid problems when sorting!!
# Demo is as follows
# best <- function(state, outcome) { ##code }
# The function checks the validity of the input variable. If an invalid state name is entered, the function should stop the program and prompt "invalid state". Also, when the input evaluate parameter is incorrect, it should prompt "invalid outcome"
# Function check:
# best("TX", "heart failure") best(“MD”, “heart attack”)  best("MD", "pneumonia") best("BB", "heart attack") best("NY", "hert attack")

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

#Create a vector with value from 1 to 10, interval of 2, and name after A
A <- seq(1,10,2)

#Write  numbers 1 to 12 three times for each iteration into the vector B: (1,1,1,...,12,12,12) Prompt rep
B <- rep(seq(1,12),each=3)

#Output the length of the B vector and the vector value after deduplication

#Output intersection of A and B, union C, difference set
intersect(A,B)

#Two 1*20 matrices are used to form two 4*5 matrices, where M1 is input by column, M2 is input by row, and M3 is calculated as M1+M2; and M4 is constructed, which is composed of M3 columns, but does not include the first 3 columns.

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
